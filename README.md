#  COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)

This project explores the global impact of COVID-19 using data analysis and visualization techniques.  
The dataset was cleaned in Python (Pandas) and visualized in Tableau to highlight the countries most and least affected by the pandemic.

---

##  Objectives
- Identify the countries most affected by COVID-19 (highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries)
- Compare countries with the least number of cases
- Visualize global patterns of infection and recovery

---

##  Data Cleaning
Performed using **Python (Pandas)**:
- Removed missing or duplicated records
- Converted dates to proper datetime format
- Exported the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_Covid-19.csv`) for Tableau visualization

---

## Visualization in Tableau
Created multiple dashboards to display:
- Top 10 most affected countries (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered)
- Least affected countries
- Global heatmap showing case intensity (dark red = high, light red = low)

## Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `cleaned_Covid-19.csv` | Final cleaned dataset |
| `covid_analysis.ipynb` | Python notebook for data cleaning |
| `dashboard_screenshot.png` | Preview of Tableau dashboard |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau Public
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

---

##  Key Insights
- The most affected countries include *[e.g., US, India, Brazil]* with high death rates.
- Least affected regions show low confirmed cases but varying recovery rates.
- Darker map regions indicate higher spread and mortality.

---

# Future Work
- Automate daily data updates via APIs
- Integrate a real-time Tableau dashboard
